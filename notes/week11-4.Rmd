_Guiding dimensionality reduction through user inputs_

1. In the academic literature, dimensionality reduction methods are usually
presented with an algorithmic focus. However, in practice, there is often a
strong human element in the application of these methods, since their value lies
in the qualitative interpretations that they support. With this in mind, we
should try to understand how interactivity can be used in the dimensionality
reduction context. Naturally, all of the techniques we’ve studied in this class
for interacting with scatterplots (e.g., dynamic linking) apply to
dimensionality reduction results.

1. For example, here is an interactive version of the UMAP from the example in
the previous notes. A brush can be used to retrieve sample details.

1. A less obvious idea is that interactivity can guide the application or
refinement of the dimensionality reduction itself. For example, it can be used
to filter the data that are input to the dimensionality reduction. More
generally, the input data may be the result of a complex preprocessing pipeline,
and parameters of that pipeline can be interactively adjusted. 

    <p align="center">
    ```{r, out.width = 600, echo = FALSE}
    include_graphics("stat679_notes/assets/week11-4/conceptual-overview.png")
    ```
    </p>


    For example, in
dimensionality reduction of temporal data, we may first want to compute a
sliding window average over time, and the widths of the windows can be chosen
interactively. For each choice of window width, the dimensionality reduction
scatterplot can be regenerated.

1. Some systems allow users to interactively label observations into classes —
this is especially common when the ultimate goal of the data science system is
to support classification. Certain dimensionality reduction methods (though not
the ones we discussed in class) can incorporate these class labels, and so can
be recomputed each time the user labels a subset of points.

1. Rather than interacting with the observations, we can interact with the
features. For example, the PCA loadings define derived features. By
interactively adjusting the values of these loadings, we can examine how the
dimensionality reduction would change when the derived features are manually
refined.

    <p align="center">
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 450}
    include_graphics("stat679_notes/assets/week11-4/feature_dimming.png")
    ```
    </p>

1. It’s also possible to interactively select between several competing
dimensionality reduction methods. This can be done using a measure of
dimensionality reduction quality, like the effectiveness with which known
clusters are separated. However, among all the types of interactivity for
dimensionality reduction techniques, this is among the rarest that is
implemented in practice.

1. In most applications, users are expected to interact either directly with the
visualization (selecting or marking points) or via external UI inputs. It’s also
possible to have the interaction through external program controls or other more
novel inputs (like speech, gestures, multitouch commands on tablets, …). Here is
a breakdown of some example interaction strategies, originally from the _Visual
Interaction with Dimensionality Reduction" survey paper.

    <p align="center">
    ```{r, out.width = 450, echo = FALSE}
    include_graphics("stat679_notes/assets/week11-4/interactions.png")
    ```
    </p>

1. Stepping back, it’s helpful to view visualization and data science
algorithms holistically. In applications where interpretation and discovery are
important, algorithms and interaction can work together to support complex
reasoning.
