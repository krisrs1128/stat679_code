1. In these notes, we’ll discuss how to implement a few types of general
graph visualizations using R and D3. For R, we’ll focus on [ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/), and
for D3, we’ll use [force-directed](https://github.com/d3/d3-force) and [adjacency matrix](https://observablehq.com/@fil/hello-reorder-js) layouts.

1. The goal of the ggraph package is to provide ggplot2-like design iteration
for graph structured (rather than tabular) data. Like ggplot2, visualizations
are built by composing layers for separate visual marks. Scale and labeling
functions are also available to customize the appearance of these marks. For
example, to build a node-link visualization, we can use the `geom_node` and
`geom_edge_link` layers. Note that `ggraph` expects a `tbl_graph` as input, not
simply a `data.frame`.

    ```{r}
    G <- as_tbl_graph(highschool)
    ggraph(G) +
      geom_edge_link(width = 0.2) +
      geom_node_point()
    ```

1. Attributes of nodes and edges can be encoded using size (node radius or edge
width) or color. The node-link representation is especially effective for the
task of following paths. It’s an intuitive visualization for examining the local
neighborhood of one node or describing the shortest path between two nodes.

    ```{r}
    G <- G %>%
      mutate(log_degree = log(local_size(), 10))
    ggraph(G) +
      geom_edge_link(width = 0.2) +
      geom_node_point(aes(col = log_degree, size = log_degree))
    ```

1. Let’s make the analogous graph in D3. We first write the data into a JSON
object with node and edge attributes -- this can be read in using `d3.json`.

    ```{r}
    nodes <- G %N>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
      select(-name)
    edges <- G %E>%
      filter(year == 1957) %>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      mutate(value = 1) %>%
      rename(source = from, target = to)
    write_json(list(edges = edges, nodes = nodes), "~/Desktop/teaching/stat679_code/examples/week9/week9-4/highschool.json")
    ```

    We can then use d3’s force-directed layout algorithm to compute a layout of
  	the nodes given a connectivity structure. The algorithm simulates forces that
  	try to repel nodes from each other, while tension on the edges keeps
  	connected pairs close to one another. Specifically, the function below
  	runs a small simulation for 100 time steps. Crucially, the running
  	the simulation modifies the `nodes` and `links` objects in place, ensuring that they
  	include the final `x` and `y` pixel coordinates. You can try tinkering with
  	the repulsion and attraction forces to see how it changes the final graph
  	layout.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
function setup_simulation(data) {
     let nodes = data["nodes"],
        links = data["edges"];

     let simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
      .force("link", d3.forceLink(links).id(d => d.id)) // attracts linked nodes
      .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody().strength(-8)) // repels all nodes
      .force("center", d3.forceCenter(300, 300)) // center of the canvas
      .tick(100); // how long to run the graph layout

      return {simulation: simulation, nodes: nodes, links: links}
}
    ```

1. Once we have run the simulation, we can access the `x` and `y` coordinates
for each node and edge and use it to draw the graph. The first block below
appends circles corresponding to nodes, and the second block draws lines that
define each link.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    let {simulation, nodes, links} = setup_simulation(data);

    d3.select("#nodes")
      .selectAll("circle")
      .data(nodes).enter()
      .append("circle")
      .attrs({
        cx: d => d.x,
        cy: d => d.y
      })

    d3.select("#links")
      .selectAll("line")
      .data(links).enter()
      .append("line")
      .attrs({
        x1: d => d.source.x,
        y1: d => d.source.y,
        x2: d => d.target.x,
        y2: d => d.target.y
      })
    ```

1. More than simply showing the layout after 100 simulation iterations, we can
redraw the visualization after every tick. The idea is that, when we run the
simulation, the `nodes` and `links` data objects will be changing after each
tick. After running one step of the simulation, we can update the circle and
line `attrs` to reflect new simulation locations. The function below
encapsulates this update.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    function ticked() {
      d3.select("#nodes")
        .selectAll("circle")
        .attrs({
          cx: d => d.x,
          cy: d => d.y
        })

      d3.select("#links")
        .selectAll("line")
        .attrs({
          x1: d => d.source.x,
          y1: d => d.source.y,
          x2: d => d.target.x,
          y2: d => d.target.y
        })
    }
    ```

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    simulation.on("tick", ticked)
    ```

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week9/week9-4/highschool-2.html" data-external="1" width=600 height=500></iframe>

1.  The addition of a `d3.drag()` listener makes it possible to manipulate the
    simulation by clicking and dragging on nodes. Specifically, we can define
    functions that "reheat" the simulation every time a drag event is started,

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    function drag_start(simulation, event) {
      if (!event.active) {
        simulation.alphaTarget(0.9).restart();
      }
    }
    ```

    and which update the simulation forces depending on the mouse's drag speed,

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    function dragged(event) {
      event.subject.fx = event.x;
      event.subject.fy = event.y;
    }
    ```

    Passing these functions into a `d3.drag()` object allows us to interact with
    the simulation as it is laying out the nodes.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    let drag = d3.drag()
      .on("start", (e) => drag_start(simulation, e))
      .on("drag", dragged);
    d3.select("#nodes")
      .selectAll("circle")
      .call(drag)
    ```

1. The key drawback of node-link diagrams is that they do not scale well to
networks with a large number of nodes or with a large number of edges per node.
The nodes and edges begin to overlap too much, and the result looks like a
[“hairball.”](https://www.visual-computing.org/2016/04/18/untangling-networks/)

    <img src="https://www.visual-computing.org/wp-content/uploads/Rice31-hairball2.png" height=500 width=500/>

1. In this case, it’s often useful to try filtering or aggregating nodes. For
example, aggregation works by replacing the original nodes with metanodes
representing entire clusters. This is especially powerful if the degree of
filtering or aggregation can be adjusted interactively — we’ll explore this
strategy when we go into more depth on graph interactivity next week.

1. Alternatively, another way to solve the hairball problem is to use another layout. We'll discuss how to use an
adjacency matrix encoding instead. The adjacency matrix of a graph is the
matrix with a 1 in entry `ij` if nodes `i` and `j` are linked by an edge and 0
otherwise. It has one row and one column for every node in the graph. Visually,
these 1’s and 0’s can be encoded as a black and white squares.
The example below shows the adjacency matrix associated with the high-school
student friendship network from last lecture. We use the “matrix” layout with a
`geom_edge_tile` layer to draw adjacency matrices in ggraph.

    ```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
    ggraph(G, layout = "matrix") +
      geom_edge_tile() +
      coord_fixed() +
      geom_node_text(aes(label = name), x = -1, nudge_y = 0.5) +
      geom_node_text(aes(label = name), y = -1, nudge_x = -0.5)
    ```

1. In D3, an adjacency matrix visualization is simply a collection of
appropriately placed SVG `rect`s.
For example, if we had an array `matrix` with elements like `[source,
target, edge_type]`, then we could draw the adjacency matrix using

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    d3.select("#graph")
      .selectAll("rect")
      .data(matrix).enter()
      .append("rect")
      .attrs({
        x: d => scales.x(d[0]),
        y: d => scales.x(d[1]),
        width: scales.x.bandwidth(),
        height: scales.x.bandwidth(),
        fill: d => scales.fill(d[2])
      })
    ```
   where `scales.x` is a `scaleBand` object mapping the network node names to
   pixel coordinates and `scales.fill` is a `scaleOrdinal` object that maps edge
   types to colors. We used exactly this code to draw the adjacency matrix below, which visualizes interactions between characters in Les Miserables.

1. Note that we have to associate each node with `x` and `y`
coordinates, and the visualization is dependent on the choice of ordering.
There are a variety of algorithms available for ordering nodes in an adjacency
matrix, but implementing this manually can be tedious. Fortunately, there is a
javascript package, [`reorder.js`](https://github.com/jdfekete/reorder.js/), that specifically supports these algorithms.
For example, the last line below returns an array giving the sorted node names
using a spectral algorithm. The details of how the algorithm works are not
important -- the main point is that nodes with highly overlapping neighborhoods
will be placed next to one another in the adjacency matrix.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    let graph = reorder.graph()
      .nodes(data["nodes"])
      .links(data["links"])
      .init();

    reorder.spectral_order(graph)
    ```

1. The key advantage of visualization using adjacency matrices is that they can
scale to large and dense networks. It’s possible to perceive structure even when
the squares are quite small, and there is no risk of edges overlapping with one
another.

1. The key disadvantage of adjacency matrix visualization is that it’s
challenging to make sense of the local topology around a node. Finding the
"friends of friends" of a node requires effort. For this reason, a number of
hybrid methods which blend node and adjacency matrix algorithms have been
proposed. We'll review a few of these next week.
