_Increased information density through faceting._

[Recording](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Week+1+-+4A+Small+Multiples+and+Faceting/1_koyt3twe), [Code](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/notes/week1-4.Rmd)

```{r, echo = FALSE}

1. It might seem like we’re limited with the total number of variables we can display at a time. While there are many types of encodings we could in theory use, only a few them are very effective, and they can interfere with one another.

2. Not all is lost, though! A very useful idea for visualizing high-dimensional data is the idea of small multiples. It turns out that our eyes are pretty good at making sense of many small plots, as long as there is some shared structure across the plots.

3. In ggplot2, we can implement this idea using the `facet_wrap` and `facet_grid` commands. We specify the column in the data.frame along which we want to generate comparable small multiples.

    ```{r}
    years <- c(1962, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2012)
    continents <- c("Europe", "Asia")
    gapminder_subset <- gapminder %>%
      filter(year %in% years, continent %in% continents)
    
    ggplot(
        gapminder_subset, 
        aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)
      ) +
      geom_point() +
      facet_grid(. ~ year) +
      theme(legend.position = "bottom")
    ```

4. In facet grid, you specify whether you want the plot to be repeated across rows or columns, depending on whether you put the variable before or after the tilde.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(
        gapminder_subset, 
        aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)
      ) +
      geom_point() +
      facet_grid(year ~ .) +
      theme(legend.position = "bottom")
    ```

5. You can also facet by more than one variable at a time, specifying which variables should go in rows and which should go in columns again using the tilde.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(
        gapminder %>% filter(year %in% years),
        aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)
      ) +
      geom_point() +
      facet_grid(year ~ continent) +
      theme(legend.position = "bottom")
    ```

6. Sometimes, you just want to see the display repeated over groups, but you don’t really need them to all appear in the same row or column. In this case, you can use `facet_wrap`.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(
        gapminder %>% filter(year %in% years),
        aes(x = fertility, y = life_expectancy, col = continent)
      ) +
      geom_point() +
      facet_wrap(~ year)
    ```
  
7. Just to illustrate, faceting makes sense for datasets other than scatterplots. This example also shows that faceting will apply to multiple geom layers at once. The dataset below shows the abundances of five different bacteria across three different subjects over time, as they were subjected to antibiotics. The data were the basis for [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20847294/).

    ```{r}
    antibiotic <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/5jmd9pku62291ek20lioevsw1c588ahx.csv")
    head(antibiotic)
    ```

8. I have also separately computed running averages for each of the variables – this is in the `svalue` column.

    ```{r}
  	ggplot(antibiotic, aes(x = time)) +
  	  geom_line(aes(y = svalue), size = 1.2) +
  	  geom_point(aes(y = value, col = antibiotic), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.8) +
  	  facet_grid(species ~ ind) +
  	  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  	  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
    ```
	
9. It seems like some of the species are much more abundant than others. In this situation, it might make sense to rescale the y-axis. Though, this is always a risky decision – people might easily misinterpret the plot and conclude that the different species all have the same abundances. Nonetheless, it can’t hurt to try, using the scale argument to `facet_grid`.

    ```{r}
  	ggplot(antibiotic, aes(x = time)) +
  	  geom_line(aes(y = svalue), size = 1.2) +
  	  geom_point(aes(y = value, col = antibiotic), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.8) +
  	  facet_grid(species ~ ind, scale = "free_y") +
  	  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  	  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
    ```

10. Unlike the years example, the facets don’t automatically come with their own natural order. We can define an order based on the average value of the responses over the course of the survey.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(antibiotic, aes(x = time)) +
      geom_line(aes(y = svalue), size = 1.2) +
      geom_point(aes(y = value, col = antibiotic), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.8) +
      facet_grid(reorder(species, value, mean) ~ ind, scale = "free_y") +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
      theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
    ```
