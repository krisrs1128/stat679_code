_An introduction `d3-geo` and `geoPath`_

[Code](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/tree/main/examples/week8/week8-3), [Recording](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Week%208%20-%203%3A%20Geospatial%20Data%20in%20D3/1_duy1w4zt)

```{r, echo = FALSE}

opts_chunk$set(

  message = FALSE,
  fig.path = "stat679_notes/assets/week8-3/"

```

1. These notes summarize methods for static visualization of geospatial data in
D3. Before we can make any plots, we need to be able to read in data. To read in
vector data, it’s most convenient to store the data as geojson and read it in
using `d3.json()`. The javascript object created by this function includes a
`features` array. Element `i` in this array gives properties of feature `i` in
the vector dataset.

1. For example, we can use this to read in and visualize the glaciers data.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    d3.json("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/main/examples/week7/week7-3/glaciers.geojson")
      .then(visualize) // we define the visualize function
    ```
    which shows an object like this in the console,

1. Even though these look like basic javascript objects, `d3.json` is
actually keeping track geographic metadata behind the scenes. This allows us to
do some basic geographic queries directly from javascript. For example, if we
want to query the geographic centroid, bounds, or areas of each feature, we can
use the calls below,
    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    let centroids = data.features.map(d3.geoCentroid),
      bounds = data.features.map(d3.geoBounds),
      areas = data.features.map(d3.geoArea);

    console.log(centroids, bounds, areas)
    ```
    You can view the console output at [this
    link](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week8/week8-3/glaciers-query.html).
    A [similar query](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/examples/week8/week8-3/road-properties.js) for the Brasilia roads dataset prints output [like this](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week8/week8-3/road-properties.html).
    A variety of related processing functions can be found in the [`d3-geo` library](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo).

1. How can we display these data? We need a way of translating the abstract data
into SVGs on the screen. For vector data, we can use D3’s `geoPath` generators.
These work like line generators — they are initialized with visual encoding
functions and can then be applied to any new collection of vector features.

1. For example, we can use a path generator to draw the glacier boundaries,

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week8/week8-3/glaciers.html" width=700 height=900></iframe>

    To draw the glacier boundaries, we defined the geographic path generator.
    The `proj` object serves a role similar to the `x` and `y` scales
    used in `d3.line()` generators -- it is mapping abstract geographical
    coordinates to the pixel extent of the screen. Specifically, `.fitSize`
    takes the spatial coordinates in `data` and relates it to the size of the
    screen, `[width, height]`. For geographic data, this process is formally
    called a `projection`, because we have to associate the surface of the 3D
    globe to a 2D plane.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    let proj = d3.geoMercator()
      .fitSize([width, height], data)
    let path = d3.geoPath()
      .projection(proj);
    ```

1. Given this `d3.geoPath()` generator, we can append one polygon per glacier in
the dataset using the usual D3 data bind. Note that we bind `data.features`
rather than just `data`. In geojson objects, the `.features` attribute contains
an array with the spatial features coordinates.

     ```{r eval = FALSE}
     d3.select("#map")
       .selectAll("path")
       .data(data.features).enter()
       .append("path")
       .attrs({
         d: path,
         fill: d => scales.fill(d.properties.Thickness)
       })
     ```

    In the block above, we've also passed a color scale to encode glacier depth
with color. In general, these geospatial data are treated just like any other
SVG `path` element, and we can set set their attributes using the usual `.attrs`
command. This is also how we achieved the mouseover effect -- we simply added a
`.on("mouseover", ...)` listener for whenever we hover over one of these paths.

1. We haven’t considered raster data in this lecture. This is because javascript
doesn’t have a simple built-in way to handle raster data. If we want to
visualize a raster dataset, we need to first convert them to simple PNG images.
This loses the geographic metadata, and so any geographic processing has to be
done before this step. In practice, it’s common to either manually convert to a
PNG or to use a tiling library, which automatically converts raster data into a
collection of PNGs. Both of these techniques are beyond the scope of our class,
but if you are curious, you can check out these resources [[1](https://datawanderings.com/2020/08/08/raster-backgrounds/), [2](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/), [3](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tiler/vignettes/tiler-intro.html)].
