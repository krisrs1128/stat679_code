1. Time often has a special role in data analysis. In the next few notes, we’ll
study some of the types of time-related questions that can be answered through
visualization. We’ll also tour some familiar (as well as some more obscure)
visualizations strategies. Throughout, we’ll restrict attention to static views
— next week, we’ll consider some interactive approaches to understanding
temporal data.

1. When we get into the details, there is no single type of time series
visualization — all designs should be tailored to the specifics of both the data
and the purpose at hand. For example, the data can vary across these
characteristics,
  
  	* Is there one series of interest? Or are there multiple series moving together?
  	* How is time recorded? Is it qualitative (e.g., early, middle, late) or quantitative (specific hour timestamp)? 
  	* What types of variables are measured at each timepoint? E.g., are they categorical, quantitative, geographic?
  	* Are the data measured at regular temporal frequencies, or is it available on an unevenly spaced grid?
  	* Are the data expected to include strong cyclic or seasonal patterns?
	
1. In addition to variation across datasets, there is variation across tasks.
The most basic questions are direct lookups,

  	* Identification: Given a timepoint of interest, what was the value of some
  	variable?
  	* Localization: Given the value of some variable, which timepoints achieved
  	it?
	
1. Instead of a direct lookup, we may instead be interested in comparison. This
can include comparison of multiple variables at a fixed timepoint or comparison
of multiple timepoints / ranges for a fixed variable. Further, we might be
interested in more than queries for specific values, we might want a “synoptic”
view of the time series, looking for higher-level trends or patterns that aren’t
visible when restricting attention to any narrow range of timepoints or variable
values.

1. In fact, there have been several efforts to systematically taxonomize the
types of queries that time series visualizations have been used for, like the
example from this week's reading,

1. It can be useful to have this theory in mind, if only because it helps
clarify the wide range of design decisions that are implicitly made anytime we
make a time series visualization. An approach that streamlines one type of
lookup / comparison might come at the cost of another, and it’s helpful to have
language to express the trade-offs involved.

1. That said, this will be enough theory for now. Let’s make some plots. First,
we begin with the simple line plot. A notable aspect of this approach is that it
highlights change. Our eyes immediately pick up the steepness, shallowness, or
roughness of different parts of the curve.

    ```{r}
    library(tsibble)
    library(tsibbledata)
    library(tidyverse)
    
    theme679 <- theme_bw() +
      theme(
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f7f7"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
      )
    theme_set(theme679)
    ```

1. For example, in the figure below, we’re showing the amount of trade in
Canadian Lynx pelts near the beginning of the 20th century. We can immediately
recognize the seasonal structure.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(pelt) +
      geom_line(aes(Year, Lynx)) +
      scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 1))
    ```

1. We made this figure using the `geom_line` geometry in ggplot2.
The `x` and `y` arguments are used to encode time and trade volume,
respectively. Alternatively, we can emphasize the fact that these are amounts
(they must be nonnegative) by drawing this as an area plot. This uses the
`geom_area` mark.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(pelt) +
      geom_area(aes(Year, Lynx)) +
      scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 1)) +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0, 0.1, 0)) 
    ```
  
1. What if we had a larger collection of time series? For example, the dataset
below includes the number of tourists in different states in Australia, measured
quarterly. We are interested in questions like, which destinations are more
popular, and when? Have there been periods when one (or several) regions were
especially popular / avoided? Is there any strong seasonal structure or are
there (upward or downward) trends?
    
    ```{r}
    # filter to most popular regions
    data(tourism)
    tourism <- tourism %>%
      filter(Purpose == "Holiday")
    
    region_totals <- tourism %>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      group_by(Region) %>%
      summarise(total_trips = sum(Trips)) %>%
      arrange(-total_trips)
    
    filter_regions <- function(x, K = 6) {
      x %>%
        filter(Region %in% region_totals$Region[1:K])
    }
    
    ggplot(filter_regions(tourism)) +
      geom_line(aes(Quarter, Trips, col = Region))
    ```
  
1. To approach these questions, we can try some simple modifications of the
lineplot. A first attempt is to include all the lines in one frame, with color
used to distinguish each state. The result is almost impossible to read, though.

    * Aside: If we hadn’t included color in our mapping, the figure would look like this. This happens because each timepoint has multiple y-values. To tell ggplot2 to create separate lines for each state, we have to use the `group` argument.
    	
    ```{r}
    ggplot(filter_regions(tourism)) +
      geom_line(aes(Quarter, Trips))
    
    ggplot(filter_regions(tourism)) +
      geom_line(aes(Quarter, Trips, group = Region))
    ```
      	
1. Another variation on the line plot is to use faceting. This works better, but
can take up quite a bit of space when there are many regions. Another downside
of this approach is that it’s hard to exactly compare the y-values for pairs of
series, since they no are no longer overlapping. Also, as soon as we have to
start scrolling up and down to compare different states, the value of the small
multiples starts dropping.

```{r}
ggplot(filter_regions(tourism, 20)) +
  geom_line(aes(Quarter, Trips)) +
  facet_wrap(~ reorder(Region, -Trips))
```

1. To address this, we could consider dropping line plots entirely. The approach
below uses a heatmap, with each state on its own line. This approach is very
compact and relatively accessible, but we no longer see trends so clearly:
differences in color are harder to evaluate than differences in y-position.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(filter_regions(tourism, 18)) +
      geom_tile(aes(Quarter, reorder(Region, Trips), fill = Trips, col = Trips)) +
      scale_fill_distiller(direction = 1) +
      scale_x_yearquarter(expand = c(0, 0)) +
      scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
      scale_color_distiller(direction = 1)
    ```
    
1. We made this using the `geom_tile` layer. Notice that we gave values for both
the fill and color arguments — without color, there would be small gaps along
the borders of each tile. Also, we reordered the `Region` column so that rows
were sorted from those with the most to the least tourism.

1. These notes have reviewed the more familiar approaches to time series
visualization. In the next lecture, we’ll consider some more obscure (but often
useful) approaches.
