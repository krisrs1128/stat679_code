1. In these notes, we continue our tour of static time series visualization
techniques, with a special emphasis on collections of time series.

1. Our first more advanced method is called the horizon plot. Below, I’ve
created a horizon plot of the Australian tourism data, along with the line plot
we made last time for comparison.

1. This figure isn’t yet standard, so let’s walk through how to read it. We’ve
taken the explanation below from the [FlowingData blog](https://flowingdata.com/2015/07/02/changing-price-of-food-items-and-horizon-graphs/). The main idea is to split
the time series into a few horizontal bands, each of which will be assigned to a
separate color. A special dividing line (the horizon line) is used to split
between two colors in a diverging color scheme.

1. Once the bands are defined, the components are all collapsed on top of one
another. In this way, even though there may be a large range in the realized
y-values, the amount of space needed to display them all is relatively small.
We’re able to decide which overall band we are in (and hence the overall value
of y) based on color.

    ```{r}
    tourism <- tourism %>%
      filter(Purpose == "Holiday")
    
    region_totals <- tourism %>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      group_by(Region) %>%
      summarise(total = sum(Trips)) %>%
      arrange(-total)
    
    cutpoints <- seq(0, 1000, by = 100)
    tourism %>%
      filter(Region %in% region_totals$Region[1:16]) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_horizon(aes(Quarter, Trips, fill = ..Cutpoints..), origin = 350, horizonscale = cutpoints) +
      scale_fill_hcl(palette = 'RdBu') +
      facet_grid(reorder(Region, -Trips) ~ .) +
      theme(
        strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
      )
    ```
    
1. We created the figure above using the `ggHoriPlot` package. We have to
specify both the horizon line (`origin`) and the cutoffs that separate the bands
(`horizonscales`). The `..Cutpoints..` term creates the color legend.

1. Overall, the horizon plot gives a reasonable compromise between faceting and
heatmaps — it preserves some of the advantages of using y-position to encode
value while having some of the compactness of heatmaps. The advantages of taking
this middle ground has been documented in research. However, the approach is not
very intuitive, and for a general audience, we typically will have to explain
how to read these figures.

1. What if we are interested more in totals and composition (i.e., values
divided by total) across a collection? A few approaches make it especially easy
to answer these types of queries.

1. To illustrate, we’ll consider the X-men appearances dataset. This includes
the number of times each character appeared on the page across all the issues of
the comic (as well as whether they were dressed normally or as superheroes
during each appearance). We’ve filtered down to just the most common characters,
to make comparison easier.


    ```{r}
    xmen <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/main/examples/week7/week7-1/x-men.csv")
    head(xmen)
    ```
    
1. One way to visualize how the total number and composition of character
appearances change over issues is to use a stacked area plot. This is the analog
of an area plot, but where multiple areas are stacked on top of one another.

    ```{r}
    # custom color palette
    pal <- c(
      "#8E038E", lighten("#8E038E", .2, space = "HLS"),
      "#C20008", lighten("#C20008", .2, space = "HLS"),
      "#13AFEF", lighten("#13AFEF", .25, space = "HLS"),
      "#595A52", lighten("#595A52", .15, space = "HLS"),
      "#FFB400", lighten("#FFB400", .25, space = "HLS")
    )
    
    ggplot(xmen) +
      geom_area(aes(issue, depicted, col = interaction(costume, char_popular), fill = interaction(costume, char_popular))) +
      scale_fill_manual(values = pal) +
      scale_color_manual(values = pal) +
      scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0, 0.1, 0)) +
      theme(legend.position = "bottom")
    ```

1. An alternative is the stream graph (also sometimes called “Theme River”). It
is like a stacked area chart, but oriented around a central (rather than base)
line. These are also almost always smoothed slightly, so that the transitions
are not too jarring.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(xmen) +
      geom_stream(aes(issue, depicted, col = interaction(costume, char_popular), fill = interaction(costume, char_popular)), bw = 0.4) +
      scale_fill_manual(values = pal) +
      scale_color_manual(values = pal) +
      theme(legend.position = "bottom")
    ```

1. There has been some controversy about whether approaches like streamgraphs
are actually more effective than area plots. Broadly speaking, one camp focuses
on functionality, evaluating approaches by user experiments on formal tasks.
Another allows aesthetic appeal to factor into decision-making. It’s not
necessary to take up any particular position in this course, but it’s good when
speaking with others in the visualization community to know that these positions
exist (and that your designs might elicit certain reactions).

1. Even though both stacked area and stream graphs make it easier to tell how
the totals at any timepoint breakdown across groups, they don’t necessarily make
it easy to rank the groups by their relative contribution (groups with similar
contributions might be hard to rank).

1. For example, consider the dataset below, which describes the number of
refugees leaving countries around the world between 2000 and 2010. The stacked
area graph shows that there was a clear increase in refugees from Iraq starting
in 2004, but it’s unclear whether this overtook Afghanistan.

    ```{r}
    refugees <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/main/examples/week7/week7-1/refugees.csv")
    ggplot(refugees) +
      geom_stream(aes(year, refugees, fill = country), bw = 1) +
      facet_wrap(~ region, scale = "free_y")
    ```
  
1. If we want to explicitly rank the groups, we can use an alluvial plot. It is
a hybrid between a bump chart and streamgraph. It is read like a stream graph,
but at each timepoint, the groups are sorted from largest to smallest
contribution. Applying it to the dataset above shows that Iraq did indeed become
the largest source of refugees within the Mideast starting around 2004.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(refugees) +
      geom_alluvium(aes(year, refugees, fill = country, alluvium = country), decreasing = FALSE, alpha = 0.9) +
      facet_wrap(~ region, scale = "free_y") +
      scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_long_scale()))
    ```
