_Useful tricks for visualizing geospatial data_

[Code](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/notes/week7-4.Rmd), [Recording](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Week+7+-+4A+Geospatial+Visualization+%28II%29/1_cquhy2wg)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(base_dir = "/", base.url = "/")
opts_chunk$set(
  warning = FALSE, 
  message = FALSE,
  fig.path = "stat679_notes/assets/week7-4/"
  )
```

1. The previous lecture outlined general methods available for visualizing
spatial and raster datasets. Those methods are used in almost every spatial data
visualization problem. In contrast, these notes are more like a grab bag of
tricks — often useful, but don’t expect to use them in every problem.

    ```{r}
    library(tigris)
    library(tmap)
    library(sf)
    library(patchwork)
    library(biscale)
    library(tidyverse)
    library(tidycensus)
    ```
  
### Vector data packages

1. What if we have data with geographic information (e.g., state names) but
which are not explicitly georeferenced? In this case, we may be able to link the
data.frame with a public vector dataset. The Natural Earth project provides a
rich catalog of vector data searchable by region, and the `rnaturalearth`
package provides a direct interface to R.

1. For example, we can find the polygon boundaries for all the counties in
Wisconsin using the code below.

    ```{r}
    wisconsin <- counties(state = "Wisconsin")
    tm_shape(wisconsin) +
      tm_polygons()
    ```

1. Similarly, we can create a choropleth of household income across all census
extracts in Dane County retrieved in the previous step.

    ```{r}
    # sign up for an api key at http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
    dane <- get_acs(
      state = "WI",
      county = "Dane",
      geography = "tract",
      variables = "B19013_001", # household income
      geometry = TRUE
    )
    
    tm_shape(dane) +
      tm_polygons(col = "estimate", palette = "Purples")
    ```
    
### Transforming Projections

1. An important subtlety of geographic data visualization is that all our maps
are in 2D, but earth is 3D. The process of associating points on the earth with
2D coordinates is called “projection.” All projections introduce some level of
distortion, and there is no universal, ideal projection.

1. A common source of bugs is to use two different projections for the same
analysis. In this class, we will always use the EPSG:4326 projection, which is
what is used in most online maps. But in your own projects, you should always
check that the projections are consistent across data sources. If you find an
inconsistency, it will be important to “reproject” the data into the same CRS.
Both `sf` and `terra` have utilities for supporting this.

### Bivariate Choropleths

1.  Choropleths are useful for encoding one data feature across a collection of
polygons. If we have more than one feature of interest, there is often little we
can do besides create several choropleths side-by-side, each with its own color
scales. An important special case is when there are exactly two continuous
variables of interest.

1. In this case, we can use something called a bivariate choropleth. This
creates a two-dimensional color palette by blending a pair of color scales.
Polygons are then encoded using this scheme. For example, in the example below,
we can see the correlation structure between obesity adn diabetes across
counties in the US.

    ```{r}
    health <- read_csv("../examples/week7/week7-3/cdc-diabetes-obesity.csv", na = "No Data") %>%
      mutate(
        diabetes_cat = cut(diabetes, 3),
        obesity_cat = cut(obesity, 3)
      )
    us_counties <- counties() %>%
      mutate(county = str_c(STATEFP, COUNTYFP)) %>%
      filter(!(STATEFP %in% c("15", "02", "60", "66", "69", "72", "78"))) %>%
      left_join(health) %>%
      bi_class(x = diabetes_cat, y = obesity_cat, style = "quantile", dim = 3)
    ```

    ```{r}
    map <- us_counties %>%
      st_simplify(dTolerance = 1000) %>% # speeds up plot by coarsening
      ggplot() +
      geom_sf(aes(fill = bi_class), size = 0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +
      bi_scale_fill(pal = "GrPink", dim = 3) +
      bi_theme()
      
    legend <- bi_legend(pal = "GrPink", dim = 3, xlab = "obesity", ylab = "diabetes")
    map + inset_element(legend, 0, 0, .3, .3, align_to = "full")
    ```

### Spatiotemporal Vis

1. What if we have the spatial data measured over time? It is common to use
faceting, with one facet per timepoint. However, this approach does not scale
well when there are many timepoints of interest. Some have advocated for the use
of [time cubes](https://aviz.fr/~bbach/spacetimecubes/Bach2014spacetimecubes.pdf), where a 2D map is repeated along a third time axis.

In this class though, we will steer away from 3D visualization. Instead, we will
focus on approaches that leverage interactivity, specifically using animation or
linked views. We’ll review some approaches next week.
