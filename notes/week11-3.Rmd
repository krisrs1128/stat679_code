_Nonlinear dimensionality reduction with UMAP_

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(base_dir = "/", base.url = "/")

1. Nonlinear dimension reduction methods can give a more faithful representation
than PCA when the data donâ€™t lie on a low-dimensional linear subspace. For
example, suppose the data were shaped like this. There is no one-dimensional
line through these data that separate the groups well. We will need an
alternative approach to reducing dimensionality if we want to preserve nonlinear
structure.

    ```{r, fig.cap = "An example nonlinear dataset where projections onto any straight line will necessarily cause the classes to bleed together."}
library(tidyverse)
library(embed)
theme_set(theme_minimal())

moons <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/kdt9qqvonhcz2ssb599p1nqganrg1w6k.csv")
ggplot(moons, aes(X, Y, col = Class)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2")
    ```

1. From a high-level, the intuition behind UMAP is to (a) build a graph joining
nearby neighbors in the original high-dimensional space, and then (b) layout the
graph in a lower-dimensional space. For example, consider the 2-dimensional sine
wave below. If we build a graph, we can try to layout the resulting nodes and
edges on a 1-dimensional line in a way that approximately preserves the
ordering.

    <p align="center">
    ```{r, fig.cap = "UMAP (and many other nonlinear methods) begins by constructing a graph in the high-dimensional space, whose layout in the lower dimensional space will ideally preserve the essential relationships between samples.", out.width = 400, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("stat679_notes/assets/week11-3/sine_wave.png")
    ```
    </p>

1. A natural way to build a graph is to join each node to its $K$ closest
neighbors. The choice of $K$ will influence the final reduction, and it is
treated as a hyperparameter of UMAP. Larger values of $K$ prioritize
preservation of global structure, while smaller $K$ will better reflect local
differences. This property is not obvious a priori, but is suggested by the
simulations described in the reading.

    <p align="center">
    ```{r, fig.cap = "When using fewer nearest neighbors, the final dimensionality reduction will place more emphasis on effectively preserving the relationships between points in local neighborhoods.", echo = FALSE, out.width = 400}
include_graphics("stat679_notes/assets/week11-3/soft_neighborhoods.png")
```
    </p>

1. One detail in the graph construction: In UMAP, the edges are assigned weights
depending on the distance they span, normalized by the distance to the closest
neighbor. Neighbors that are close, relative to the nearest neighbors, are
assigned higher weights than those that are far away, and points that are linked
by high weight edges are pulled together with larger force in the final graph
layout. This is what the authors mean by using a ``fuzzy'' nearest neighbor
graph. The fuzziness allows the algorithm to distinguish neighbors that are very
close from those that are far, even though they all lie within a
$K$-nearest-neighborhood.

    <p align="center">
    ```{r, fig.cap = "When using larger neighborhoods, UMAP will place more emphasis on preserving global structure, sometimes at the cost of local relationships between points.", out.width = 400, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("stat679_notes/assets/week11-3/soft_neighborhoods_large_k.png")
```
    </p>

1. Once the graph is constructed, there is the question of how the graph layout
should proceed. UMAP uses a variant of force-directed layout, and the global
strength of the springs is another hyperparameter. Lower tension on the springs
allow the points to spread out more loosely, higher tension forces points closer
together. This is a second hyperparameter of UMAP.

    <p align="center">
    ```{r, out.width = 350, echo = FALSE}
    include_graphics("stat679_notes/assets/week11-3/graph_layout.png")
    ```
    </p>

1. In R, we can implement this using almost the same code as we used for PCA.
The `step_umap` command is available through the embed package.

    ```{r}
    theme_set(theme_bw())
    cocktails_df <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/qyqof2512qsek8fpnkqqiw3p1jb77acf.csv")
    umap_rec <- recipe(~., data = cocktails_df) %>%
      update_role(name, category, new_role = "id") %>%
      step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
      step_umap(all_predictors(), neighbors = 20, min_dist = 0.1)
    umap_prep <- prep(umap_rec)
    ggplot(juice(umap_prep), aes(UMAP1, UMAP2)) +
      geom_point(aes(color = category), alpha = 0.7, size = 0.8) +
      geom_text(aes(label = name), check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3, hjust = "inward")
    ```


1. We can summarize the properties of UMAP,

  	* Global or local structure: The number of nearest neighbors K used during
  	graph construction can be used modulate the emphasis of global vs. local
  	structure.
  	* Nonlinear: UMAP can reflect nonlinear structure in high-dimensions.
  	* No interpretable features: UMAP only returns the map between points, and
  	there is no analog of components to describe how the original features were
  	used to construct the map.
  	* Slower: While UMAP is much faster than comparable nonlinear dimensionality
  	reduction algorithms, it is still slower than linear approaches.
  	* Nondeterministic: The output from UMAP can change from run to run, due to
  	randomness in the graph layout step. If exact reproducibility is required, a
  	random seed should be set.
