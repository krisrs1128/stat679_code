[Code](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/notes/week10-3.Rmd), [Recording](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Week%2010%20-%203%3A%20Graph%20Interactivity%20II/1_zbx9zb6t)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)

```

1. These notes continue our tour of graph interactivity. We’ll explore how
certain graph queries can be more easily answered by allowing users to modify
visual encodings (Encoding Interactivity) and the form of the data that are
displayed (Data Interactivity).

1. Let’s begin with encoding interactivity. One simple example of this type of
interactivity is highlighting. This changes the visual appearance of different
nodes or edges based on user interest. For example, in either node link or
adjacency matrix views, we can highlight one-step neighborhoods based on the
position of the user’s mouse. For example, here is an example for node-link
views,

	and here is one for adjacency matrix views,

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week10/week10-1/miserables-adj-neighbors.html" data-external="1" height=450 width=600></iframe>

1. In both of these examples, we first build a data structure containing the
neighbors of each node in the graph. For example the array following `0: ` gives
the indices of all nodes that are neighbors with node `0`,

    ```{r, out.width = 350, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
    include_graphics("stat679_notes/assets/week10-1/neighbors-js.png")
    ```

    Once we have this data structure, we can quickly look up neighbors every
    time we hover over a node (or matrix tile in the adjacency matrix view). We
    then update the graphical marks to reflect these neighborhoods. In the
    node-link view, we highlight the neighbors in red using the following update,

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    d3.select("#nodes")
      .selectAll("circle")
      .attrs({
        fill: d => neighbors[ix].indexOf(d.index) == -1 ? "black" : "red"
      })
      ```

    and similarly, for the adjacency matrix visualization, we change the x-label
    font size and opacity using this so that only the neighbors are visible,

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
d3.select("#xlabels")
  .selectAll("text")
  .attrs({
        "font-size": d => d.index == target? 14 : 10,
        "opacity": d => neighbors[source].indexOf(d.index) == -1? 0 : 1
  })
      ```

1. Conceptually, there is nothing unique about this interactivity code, compared
to what we already have used for more basic plots (e.g., for scatterplots), and
many of the techniques we learned earlier apply here. For example, if want to
allow the user to select a node without placing their mouse directly over it, we
can adapt the Delaunay lookups that we have [previously
used](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_notes/2022/06/01/week6-3.html) in
scatterplot interaction. Here is an implementation of this idea by Alex Macy,

1. Brushing and linking is often used for encoding interactivity. Properly
coordinated views can be used to highlight nodes or edges with a particular
property. For example, suppose we wanted to a simple way of highlighting all the
hubs in a network (i.e., nodes with many neighbors). One idea is to link a
histogram of node degrees with the actual node-link diagram. In principle, we
could modify a variety of node and edge attributes based on user interactions
(size, color, line type, …).

1. Next, let’s consider data interactions. Two common types of data interactions
are user-guided filtering and aggregation. In filtering, we remove data from
view — this can be determined by UI inputs, dynamic queries, or direct
manipulation of marks on the screen. For example, here we filter edges based on
their edge-betweeness-centrality (a measure of how many paths go through that
edge). This is helpful for isolating the “backbone” of the network.

    <iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week10/week10-3/interactome-2.html" data-external="1" height=450 width=600></iframe>

1. To implement this view, we use the standard enter-update-exit pattern. We
used the brush selection to change the subset of edges that should be bound to
the SVG lines defining the links. We had precomputed the edge centralities in
advance, so updating the displayed marks is simply a matter of determining which
edge array elements to display.

1. Pruning reduces the number of marks on the display by removing some. In
contrast, aggregation reduces the number of marks by collapsing many into a few.
One approach to aggregation is to clump tightly connected clusters of nodes into
metanodes. This is a special case of “semantic zooming”  — instead of simply
resizing a static collection of elements, semantic zooming modifies the elements
that are shown so that additional details are shown on demand.

1. For example, a semantic zoom with two zoom levels would allow the user to
collapse and expand metanodes based on user interest.  Here is an implementation
by @rymarchikbot. The construction of the enclosing paths is similar to our
`convex_hull`-based compound graph visualization from the first set of notes for
this week.

1. Both filtering and aggregation work by refocusing our attention on graph
structures, either from the top down (removing less interesting elements) or
from the bottom up (combining similar ones). An intermediate strategy is based
on graph navigation.

1. The main idea of graph navigation is to start zoomed in, with only a small
part of the graph visible. Then, based on user interest, we can visually signal
those directions of the graph that are especially worth moving towards.
Concretely, it is possible to define a degree-of-interest function across the
collection of nodes, as formalized by [(Van Ham and Perer 2009)](https://dig.cmu.edu/publications/2009-doigraphs.html). This function can update based on user inputs. The encoding
of the graph can then be modified to suggest that certain regions be focused in
on.

    ```{r, out.width = 350, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
    include_graphics("stat679_notes/assets/week10-1/2009-doigraphs.png")
    ```

1. Note that this is different from the overview-plus-detail principle that we
have used in many places. It is helpful when attempting to overview the entire
network may not be necessary and exploring local neighborhoods is enough to
answer most questions.

1. Together, view, encoding, and data interaction provide a rich set of
techniques for exploring graph data. Moreover, many of the techniques we
described here are still areas of active research, and perhaps in the future, it
will be easier to design and implement graph interactions suited to specific
problems of interest.
